     * This change detection method works by computing the observed values and their mean up to the current
     * moment. Page Hinkley won't output warning zone warnings, only change detections. The method works by
     * means of the Page Hinkley test. In general lines it will detect a concept drift if the observed mean
     * at some instant is greater then a threshold value lambda.

     * @param {float}   delta               The delta factor for the Page Hinkley test.
     * @param {int}     lambda              The change detection threshold.
     * @param {float}   alpha               The forgetting factor, used to weight the observed value and the mean.
