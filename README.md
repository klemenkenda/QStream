# QStream

Playground for stream mining in JavaScript. Partially based on [Scikit Multiflow](https://github.com/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow). Useful methods will be finally ported to [QMiner](http://qminer.github.io).

## Moved to QMiner

Here are all the streaming solutions that have been moved from JavaScript prototype library to QMiner.

* Page-Hinkley test was implemented as a stream aggregate in QMiner
